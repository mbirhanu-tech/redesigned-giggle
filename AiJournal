Week 2 (09/08–09/14)  

This week I used AI to support my daily work and studying in a few different ways.  
- I asked AI to summarize a long article about renewable energy so I could better understand the main arguments before writing my class notes.  
- I used AI to practice interview questions for an upcoming job fair; it gave me sample answers that I rephrased in my own words.  
- I asked AI to explain how to create pivot tables in Excel, which I then practiced on a dataset for one of my assignments.  
- I also experimented with AI for creative writing by asking it to suggest alternative titles for a short story draft I’m working on.

I found AI most useful this week for simplifying complex material and sparking ideas. I was careful not to copy its answers directly, but instead used them as a starting point to build my own work.

Week 3

This week I used AI to support my learning and coding practice in Python, focusing mainly on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
I learned the difference between class and instance variables with examples.
I debugged errors like AttributeError and TypeError: unhashable type: list.
I explored __init__ and __str__ methods and inheritance with real-world analogies.
I practiced with AI-generated multiple-choice quizzes and small projects, like a mini bank account system under 50 lines.

Week 4
Week 4 (09/22–09/28)

This week I used AI mainly for object-oriented design practice.
- I asked AI to model a real-world Car as a Python class. The first draft covered basics (make, model, year, VIN), but it missed behavior. I revised my prompt to require fuel efficiency, tank/battery size, odometer, maintenance interval and methods like estimate_range(), trip_cost(), refuel/charge(), and service_due().
- I then asked for subclasses—GasCar, ElectricCar, Hybrid—and quick unit tests. Running the tests helped me spot edge cases (negative inputs, overfilling).
- I used AI to explain two errors I hit (AttributeError from a typo and a division by zero in estimate_range) and to generate docstrings I edited to match my code.
- I finished by writing my own version from scratch, using the AI output only as a reference.

What I learned: Good prompts ask for both attributes and behaviors plus tests. AI is a great starting point, but I still need to verify logic and performance myself.

Week 5

- ChatGPT to better understand how Python achieves encapsulation through private attributes and the use of @property and @setter.
- Conceptual questions about why properties are preferred over direct attribute access.
- The AI helped me learn how getters and setters enforce validation, readability, and non-negative or restricted values.
- It also explained the purpose of information hiding and how it improves clean, maintainable class design.
- Overall, I used AI mainly for clarification and concept reinforcement, not to automatically complete the code.
