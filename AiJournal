Week 2 (09/08–09/14)  

This week I used AI to support my daily work and studying in a few different ways.  
- I asked AI to summarize a long article about renewable energy so I could better understand the main arguments before writing my class notes.  
- I used AI to practice interview questions for an upcoming job fair; it gave me sample answers that I rephrased in my own words.  
- I asked AI to explain how to create pivot tables in Excel, which I then practiced on a dataset for one of my assignments.  
- I also experimented with AI for creative writing by asking it to suggest alternative titles for a short story draft I’m working on.

I found AI most useful this week for simplifying complex material and sparking ideas. I was careful not to copy its answers directly, but instead used them as a starting point to build my own work.

Week 3

This week I used AI to support my learning and coding practice in Python, focusing mainly on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
I learned the difference between class and instance variables with examples.
I debugged errors like AttributeError and TypeError: unhashable type: list.
I explored __init__ and __str__ methods and inheritance with real-world analogies.
I practiced with AI-generated multiple-choice quizzes and small projects, like a mini bank account system under 50 lines.
